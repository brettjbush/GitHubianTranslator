A simple Java application to teach basic GitHub concepts

```
Have you ever wondered how Octocat's talk to eachother? They speak in GitHubian! 
This ancient language was the forefather of "l33t sp34k" and follows these rules, in order, when translated from English:
Step 1) All letters are converted to lower case
Step 2) All instances of the word "it" are replaced with "git"
Step 3) All instances of the period "." are replaced with exclamation points "!"
Step 4) The following letters are translated as so:
  - a => 4
  - e => 3
  - i => 1
  - o => 0
  - s => 5
  - t => 7
  - z => 2
  
Researchers are still learning the ways of GitHubian, so there may be more steps added in the future!
